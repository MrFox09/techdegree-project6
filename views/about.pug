            | I am passioned about to solve problems. It's about finding the most elegant way to write a line of code which fits best into a progression, I love the challenge of finding a way and discovering solutions.

            | My name is Christian Fuchs, I live in Austria, yeah it's NOT Australia! ^^ Currently I work for Quindoo a IT Company as a Junior Business Consultant.
            | In my spare time I am studying at Treehouse to strengthen my software developer skills. 
 
           
            | For me, it’s very exciting to create something new. Back then, when I was a 10 year old kid, it was always fascinating how PC’s and the software work.
            | But couldn't find it what is going on there. 
 
          
            | Then in my early 20's when I was doing my Matura(A-Level), with a focus on media informatics, I knew that one day I wanted to work creatively with my PC. 
            | I am convinced that my future lies in this profession. Therefore I spend the most of my freetime to get this done.

            | When I have a day off, I really like hiking and go to the top of the beautiful mountains here, I enjoy the beautiful nature with my small family there. I like to climb aswell, especially bouldering because you always have to solve a problem there too.
            | This all really helps to recharge, from a busy live.
